# Printer
The Anycubic [**Kobra 2 Max**](https://www.anycubic.com/products/kobra-2-max) is a high speed FDM bedslinger style printer.  
It comes pre-assembled, you only have to mount a few parts like the 'upstanding' frame onto the base frame.  

See [Anycubic's support page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software) of the Kobra 2 series to find manuals, firmware, video tutorials and more or use the direct links in the following.

## Box Content

The printer comes partially preassembled and well packed in one big box.  
Unfortunately I don't have pictures of the box content of the Kobra 2 Max, so I'll show you the box content of the Kobra 2 Pro instead - besides the obviously different parts of the machine itself, it'll basically be the same.

Along with the printer come some additional parts, like a sample of PLA, a USB drive, some tools, a spare nozzle and so on. You can see these items in the following picture.
